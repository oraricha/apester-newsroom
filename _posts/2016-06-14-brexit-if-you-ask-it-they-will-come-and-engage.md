<h1><strong>Brexit: if you ask it, they will come (and engage)</strong></h1>
There’s definitely something to be said for sitting atop a mountain of data. The air’s fresh, the view’s amazing and we get to see things a lot clearer.

Data mountain, for example, is <a href="http://news.apester.com/aol-apester-poll-won-super-tuesday-2-predicted-michigan-upset-2/" target="_blank">how we knew Bernie Sanders was going to win Michigan</a> a few weeks back.

As we're reaching the final stages of a long, hard-fought EU referendum battle, things are definitely heating up around our vast network: more people are talking about it, asking about it, getting creative about it and feel increasingly inclined to join in on the discussion.

More Apester interactive content is being created per day and more angles of the issue explored, including <a href="http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/679067/england-fans-euro-2016-anti-eu-songs-brexit" target="_blank">How do you think Paul Gascoigne would vote in the EU referendum?</a> (94% say leave). If you wondered.

We took all that data and had a deeper look into the numbers and get a hold of this tidbit: in the run up to June 23 - just mention the term “referendum” in an Apester poll and you’re guaranteed 30% engagement rate (see graph below). That’s sky high, instant engagement.
If you ask it, they will come.<img class="alignnone wp-image-472 size-full" src="http://news.apester.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/06/image.png" alt="" width="910" height="315" />

(Engagement Rate - CTR - on Referendum related interactive items on the Apester network)

Capitalising on burning issues like the referendum while producing amazing statistical and editorial value is definitely one of the secrets to getting more out of Apester (a badly kept secret, we told everyone).

There are many ways to produce that value:
<ul>
	<li>Bolster editorial coverage with Apester and <a href="http://www.dailystar.co.uk/showbiz-tv/hot-tv/519985/Matt-LeBlanc-in-talks-to-sign-on-for-second-series-of-Top-Gear" target="_blank">adding interactive angles to your articles</a></li>
	<li>Got a hot topic on your hands? Don’t settle for just one poll. Ask multiple questions (for example, the new <a href="http://www.express.co.uk/showbiz/tv-radio/679462/Chris-Evans-returning-second-series-Top-Gear-backlash-Matt-LeBlanc" target="_blank">Top Gear</a> and <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/2016/06/12/top-gear-episode-3-matt-leblancs-cenotaph-stunt-and-chris-evans/" target="_blank">another one</a>, and <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/top-gear-fans-call-for-jenson-button-to-replace-shouty-chris-evans-as-host-a7067031.html" target="_blank">another</a>).
Reuse the same poll/quiz in a range of articles like IBTimes did for Euro 2016 - <a href="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/poland-euro-2016-team-profile-robert-lewandowski-pivotal-hopes-maiden-knock-out-appearance-1561740" target="_blank">here</a>, <a href="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/euro-2016-player-watch-marko-arnautovic-revitalised-stoke-forward-can-inspire-austria-after-1563526" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/england-euro-2016-team-profile-wayne-rooney-role-casts-shadow-over-three-lions-ambitions-1563574" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
The above not only contributes to major metrics like engagement, Time on Site and shares, but first and foremost gives you a direct insight into your users opinions and preferences. That’s the power of injecting an interactive component into your stories.

In 2016 embedded tweets simply don’t cut it anymore. The internet is the land of conversation, which WILL take place somewhere, might as well have it on YOUR site.

And before we go, have a look at what The DailyStar did with a bit of location data. They asked their readers about Hooligans as Euro 2016 kicked off, then used the results, plus data provided by us, in a <a href="http://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/latest-news/521368/Euro-2016-tournament-hardest-hooligan-league-revealed-Daily-Star-Online-reader-poll" target="_blank">follow up story</a>.

And that’s just the tip of the mountain.
