Apester is letting the WORLD decide! 

The greatest moment in olympic history should be decided in the biggest poll <strong>EVER</strong> and that is exactly what's happening, and you can join in!

Simply embed this code into any Olympic article you create and let your readers pick their favorite moments!

<pre><code>&lt;iframe src="//renderer.qmerce.com/interaction/578752d0eaef76d524c3cbce" width="100%" height="796" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</code></pre>

Be a part of our one of a kind project, spanning 5 continents, as Apester’s global network of thousands of sites and over 200 million monthly users across the world come together to vote for that special moment, in what will become the most extensive poll ever conducted!

Starting off with 40 candidates, our global community will vote to advance their favorites to the second round, the semi-final, and will finally decide on the winner.

When it’s all said and done our huge network will have chosen the single most glorious moment in olympic history!

Give <b>your</b> readers a chance to celebrate the olympic games and influence the final say!

All you need to do is pick up the embed code and use it on as many Olympic related stories to allow as many votes as possible, the rest is up to us!
