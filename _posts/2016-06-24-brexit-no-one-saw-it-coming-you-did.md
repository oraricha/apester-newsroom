<strong>No one saw it coming? You did.</strong>

What a jaw-dropping result. At least half the nation is in a state of shock. Who knew? No one believed they’d pull that trigger, no one really thought they’d actually go through with it. Some last minute polls showed a small gap for Remain but it was all too close to call. Did anyone see it coming?

The millions of voters on the Apester network did.

Voters shared that sentiment over and over again in the past weeks as the UK was engulfed by a great wave of percentages, splits, point-swings and undecided voters, by leave, remain, in and out, yes and no - while the old continent and the rest of the world stood by in anticipation.

(Naturally, the referendum became a huge topic on our network, making <a href="http://news.apester.com/brexit-if-you-ask-it-they-will-come-and-engage/" target="_blank">“referendum” one of the most engaging terms we’ve seen.</a>)

Publishers across our vast network asked about it repeatedly, exploring every angle and trying to gauge the ever elusive wind direction in the run up to this historic decision. From the Telegraph to Bath Chronicle, from The Independent to Hull Daily, From Business Insider to Gloucester Citizen, they all wanted to know what you think. And you were quite clear about it, actually.

From a bird’s eye view of hundreds of Apester items on tens of sites in the UK and the world - the user’s voice spoke loud and the sentiment was clear.

The people wanted out.

Have a look at the top 10 most engaging items on the referendum from our network, a small sample of a huge amount of polls created in the run up to the actual referendum. The bottom line is staggering: 63% leave, 37% remain.

<strong>How Apester is shining a light on Brexit uncertainty</strong>

So what happens now? A number of polls on our network are starting to reveal what the public thinks on the key questions and challenges posed by Brexit.

From the Conservative leadership debate to Britain’s economic forecast, Apester users are voting in their thousands and are helping to provide an accurate barometer of the public mood so far.

Telegraph readers had their say on who they think should become the next leader of the Conservatives. 40% of voters think Boris Johnson should be the next prime minster, with another 20% opting for Home Secretary Theresa May.

<a href="http://www.crawleynews.co.uk/who-is-favourite-to-be-the-next-prime-minister/story-29439655-detail/story.html" target="_blank">Readers of Crawley News</a> also feel that Boris should be the next party leader earning with 40% of the vote yet again, but are more split on who the other candidates should be.

It’s also bad news for Boris’ main leadership rival George Osborne, <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/24/so-long-george-osborne-the-so-called-master-strategist/" target="_blank">an overwhelming majority</a> think that the Chancellor is now ‘toast’.

Was Cameron right to quit as Tory leader? <a href="http://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/latest-news/525273/Conspiracy-Brexit-vote-counter-rigging-EU-referendum-Britain-UK" target="_blank">73% of Daily Star readers</a> say he made the correct decision with only 27% saying it was the wrong call.

Star readers also have <a href="http://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/latest-news/525276/EU-Brexit-leave-jean-claude-juncker-reaction-european-union-Britain-UK" target="_blank">mixed feelings</a> on Brexit and what the potential repercussions of the vote will be in the future.

<a href="http://money.aol.co.uk/2016/06/24/results-are-in-britain-will-leave-the-eu-what-will-it-mean-fo/" target="_blank">Over at AOL</a>, half of voters think Brexit is bad, 40% think it will benefit the UK economy and 10% feel it won’t affect them in the slightest.

The LadBible, with a typically younger demographic, <a href="http://www.theladbible.com/articles/this-chart-regarding-age-group-and-the-eu-referendum-is-really-pissing-people-off-240616" target="_blank">asked its readership</a> on whether the older generation is to blame. Unsurprisingly two-thirds are unhappy with how the vote went and blame their elders.

[iframe src="//preview.qmerce.com/interaction/576d0e5aeaef76d524aea9b4" width="100%" height="382" scrolling="no"]

Meanwhile, the Daily Express has a more unusual theory: <a href="http://www.express.co.uk/news/weird/683027/BEGINNING-OF-THE-END-Shock-claims-Brexit-vote-signals-start-of-THE-RAPTURE" target="_blank">Does the Leave vote signal the end of the world?</a> While only 11% subscribe to the theory while 54% simply think the vote will make Great Britain again. Time will tell!
